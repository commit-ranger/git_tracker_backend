<!--? THE MAIN IDEA -->
This git tracker will populate a page with a repo filled with files organized into folders. the files will be a series of radio buttons 0 being unassigned and the others being assigned to only be selected if you have authorization. 
<!--* DAY IN THE LIFE -->
As a developer you need to work in a file, but instead of searching discord or asking who has said file you go into git tracker and look for the file you need, then you can see if it is in use or not. 
You see it is not in use so you select it and save, 
when gitCommit the file you go back into the git tracker and hit clear on your section and all of the files you had selected get returned to unassigned so others can grab it. 
If you want to see what files someone else is working on you can click that persons group and all of the files in use by this person will replace the other files.
